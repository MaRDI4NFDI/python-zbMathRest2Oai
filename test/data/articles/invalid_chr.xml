    <text>Summary: \textit{A. S. Kechris} et al. [Geom. Funct. Anal. 15, No. 1, 106--189 (2005; Zbl 1084.54014)] provided a powerful tool to compute an invariant of topological groups known as the universal minimal flow, immediately leading to an explicit representation of this invariant in many concrete cases. More recently, the framework was generalized allowing for further applications, and the purpose of this paper is to apply these new methods in the context of homogeneous directed graphs.


     In this paper, we show that the age of any homogeneous directed graph allows a Ramsey precompact expansion. Moreover, we verify the relative expansion properties and consequently describe the respective universal minimal flows.</text>

This is independent of the choice An−1A0 of A0since B0is χ0-monochromatic. Therefore, there is a χ1-monochromatic B1∈C1, Bn−1 and thus B0t B1is χ-monochromatic as desired. Theorem 6.3.

    <text>∗. Then A and A0are isomorphic if and only if there is an order preserving bijection f : coll(A) → coll(A0) such that for every i, {j : (i, j) ∈ A} = {j : (f (i), j) ∈ A0}. From this we immediately obtain the following using the usual Ramsey Theorem. Theorem 7.7. The class Age(Iω[C3]∗) satisfies the Ramsey property. And similarly for the expansion property. Theorem 7.8. The class Age(Iω[C3]∗) satisfies the expansion property with respect to Age(Iω[C3]). Proof. Let A ∈ Age(Iω[C3]), then any expansion A∗of A will embed in any expansion of {(i, j) : i ∈ coll(A), j ∈ [3]}. 8Complete n-partite directed graphs For n 6 ω, by a complete n-partite directed graph we mean a directed graph such that the non-edge relation ⊥ is an equivalence relation with at most n many classes. For each n, the class of all such graphs is a Fra¨ıss´e class. The corresponding limit is denoted n ∗ Iω, and consists of n many disjoint copies of Iωbetween which edges are distributed in a complete and random way. For n ∈ N we construct the expansion n ∗ Iω∗by adding a convex linear ordering together with n many unary relations Pin∗Iω∗corresponding to the parts of n ∗ Iωand so that P0n∗Iω∗&lt;n∗Iω∗· · · &lt;n∗Iω∗Pn−1n∗Iω∗. For n = ω, construct ω ∗ Iω∗by simply adding to ω ∗ Iωa convex linear ordering that orders each part in a dense linear order, as well as the set of parts in a dense linear order; note that we do not add any unary predicates in this case. Those expansions are precompact, and we show that their ages have the Ramsey property and show the appropriate expansion properties. If B is a complete n-partite directed graph, say that a subgraph is transversal when it has exactly one point in each ⊥ equivalence class of B. the electronic journal of combinatorics 21(4) (2014), #P4.4216 Remark 8.1. It came to the attention of the authors that there is a simpler proof of the lemmas below, based on the result in [S13-2]: One takes the output of the result of [S13-2] and prunes it, arriving at an element of the age of n ∗ Iω. Though, we include the direct proof based on the partite construction, we will revisit the result of [S13-2] in section 9. Lemma 8.2. Let n, r ∈ N be positive and suppose B is a finite substructure of n ∗ Iω∗with exactly n parts. Suppose A is an n-partite directed subgraph of B which is transversal. Then there exists a finite n-partite graph C such that C → (B)Ar. Proof. This is identical to the proof of the partite lemma in [NR89]. Suppose now that A is a directed subgraph of B, and that the parts of B are written Yiwith i ∈ [n]. Define the trace of A (in B) to be tr(A) = {i : A ∩ Yi6= ∅}. For x ∈ B, define the trace of x to be tr(x) = tr({x}), thus x ∈ Ytr(x). We begin with the following special case of the Ramsey property. Lemma 8.3. Let n, r ∈ N with r &gt; 0, suppose A 6 B are finite substructure of n ∗ Iω∗ with exactly n parts each. Then there exists a finite C ⊆ n ∗ Iω∗such that C → (B)Ar. Proof. What follows is a modification of the partite construction in [NR89]. Let A and B be as above, and denote by Yi, with i &lt; n, the parts of B. Set a = |A|, b = |B|, ai= |A ∩ Yi|, and bi= |B ∩ Yi| for i &lt; n. By Lemma 3.2, there exist disjoint Ci⊆ N with i &lt; n, such that (C0, . . . , Cn−1) → (b0, . . . , bn−1)(ar0,...,an−1). We can assume that C0= {1, . . . , |C0|} and in general, Ci= {max(Ci−1) + 1, . . . , max(Ci−1) + |Ci|}. Set p = max(Cn−1). Enumerate C0, . . . , Cn−1 = {N1, . . . , Nα}, a0, . . . , an−1 and C0, . . . , Cn−1 = {M1, . . . , Mβ}. b0, . . . , bn−1 Now for every j ∈ [β], Mjis a disjoint union of Ajk’s such that Ajk= Mj∩ Ck, for every k &lt; n. Construct a substructure Q0of n ∗ Iω∗as follows: the vertex set Q0consists of all pairs (i, j) such that i ∈ Mj. For each j ∈ [β], reproduce a copy Bjof B with universe the electronic journal of combinatorics 21(4) (2014), #P4.4217 {(i, j) : i ∈ Mj}, so that PkBj= Bj∩ Ck(for every k &lt; n) and (i, j) &lt;Bj(i0, j) if and only if i &lt; i0. To complete our set of edges, for every i &lt; i0and j &lt; j0, if i ∈ Ajkand i0∈ Ajk00 where k &lt; k0, then we add ((i, j), (i0, j0)). For every k ∈ [n], PkQ0is the disjoint union of Bj Pk’s. Moreover, we set each non-structural part to be Mi= {(i, j) : j ∈ [β]} for i ∈ [p]. Finally, add a linear ordering (convex with respect to both partitions) that extends the linear orderings that already exist on each copy of B: If j &lt; j0, then set (i, j) &lt;Q0(i, j0). If i &lt; i0, j 6= j0, then set (i, j) &lt;Q0(i0, j0). The resulting structure is Q0. Next, we construct a sequence Q1, . . ., Qαinductively using lemma 8.3, as in [NR89]. To construct Qifrom Qi−1, we first consider the directed subgraph of Qi−1whose trace is Ni−1with respect to the non-structural partition, call it Hi−1. Applying lemma 8.3, we get an a-partite Gi−1such that Gi−1→ (Hi−1)Ar. Subsequently, we expand each copy of Hi−1to a copy of Qi−1, and add a convex (with respect to the structural partition) linear ordering that extends all the linear orderings that already exist on each copy of Qi−1. We call the result Qi. Following this procedure, the directed graph induced by the structure Qαis not complete with respect to the structural partition, but it can be made complete by adding new edges. Let C be any structure obtained that way. We claim that C is as required. Let χ :AC→ [r] be any colouring. Then there will be Q0∈QC0 such that the colouring of each copy of A depends only on its trace with respect to the non-structural partition. The conclusion follows from the construction of Q0now using routine arguments. We are now ready to prove the general result. Theorem 8.4. The age of n ∗ Iω∗has the Ramsey property for each n ∈ N. Proof. Let k 6 n, r ∈ N with r &gt; 0, B a finite substructure of n ∗ Iω∗with exactly n parts, and A is a substructure of B with k parts. Then we will show that there exists a finite C ⊆ n ∗ Iω∗with n parts such that C → (B)Ar. Note that because of the unary relations that are interpreted as the parts of n ∗ Iω∗, all copies of A in B have same trace τ . Let ¯B be the substructure of B induced by the points v ∈ B with tr(v) ∈ τ . Apply Lemma 8.3 to find ¯C such that ¯C → ( ¯B)Ar. σ be the trace of B. Now extend each copy of ¯B in ¯C to a copy of ¯B, via amalgamation. Set C to be the result of this extension with appropriate edges and linear ordering added. This result allows us to show the same is true for the infinite partite structure. the electronic journal of combinatorics 21(4) (2014), #P4.4218 Theorem 8.5. The age of ω ∗ Iω∗has the Ramsey property. Proof. Let k 6 n, r ∈ N with r &gt; 0, B a finite substructure of ω ∗ Iω∗with n parts, and A a substructure of B with k parts. Expand for the moment ω ∗Iω∗with unary predicates corresponding to its parts, calling the resulting structure ω ∗ Iω∗∗. Using Ramsey’s theorem, we can find N such that N → (n)kr, and we enumerate the n-subsets of [N ] as τ1, . . . , τ``. For each i 6 l consider a copy Biof B with trace τiin ω ∗ Iω∗so that the Bi’s are pairwise disjoint. Set ¯B to be the substructure of ω ∗ Iω∗supported by the union of these Bi’s. Note that all copies of A with fixed trace in ω ∗ Iω∗induce isomorphic structures in ω ∗ Iω∗∗. Using Theorem 8.4, we can find a finite substructure C of ω ∗ Iω∗such that every r-colouring χ ofAC, there exists a copy ¯B0∈CB¯ such that χ restricted toB¯A0 depends only on the trace. To complete the proof, define ¯χ :Nk → [r] by setting ¯χ(σ) to be the colour of any copy of A in ¯B0with trace σ; this is well defined by construction. By the choice of N , there is a ¯χ-monochromatic τi0, and by construction, there is B0∈B¯0 with trace τ Bi0, which completes the proof. We now more to the expansion property, and note that the proof of the theorem below follows the template found in the proof of Lemma 5.2 in [N96] and the proofs of the expansion properties found in [S13-1]. Theorem 8.6. The age of ω ∗ Iω∗satisfies the expansion property with respect to the age of ω ∗ Iω. Proof. Let A ∈ Age(ω ∗ Iω), and fix an arbitrary a convex linear ordering &lt; on A. We will produce a structure B ∈ Age(ω ∗ Iω) such that A∗embeds in any expansion of B. Consider the following structures: • E1is the linearly ordered directed graph with universe {a, b} and the directed edge (a, b) such that a &lt; b. • E2is the linearly ordered directed graph with universe {a, b} and no edges such that a &lt; b. Set &lt;revto be the same as &lt; but with the ordering on each part (i.e., the ordering on non-edges) reversed. Set &gt;revto be the same as &gt; but with the ordering on each part reversed. Now find A1∈ Age(ω ∗ Iω∗) so that (A, &lt;), (A, &gt;), (A, &lt;rev) and (A, &gt;rev) embed in A1, and similarly find A2∈ Age(ω ∗ Iω∗) so that A1, E1and E2all embed in A2. Since Age(ω ∗ Iω∗) satisfies the Ramsey property, we can find Ci∈ Age(ω ∗ Iω∗) so that C1→ (A2)E21and C2→ (C1)E22. Let &lt;0be the ordering on C2, and ≺ be any convex linear ordering on C2, and consider the following colouring on ordered pairs in the universe of C2: ( 0if the two orders &lt;0and ≺ agree on {u, v}. χ((u, v)) = 1otherwise the electronic journal of combinatorics 21(4) (2014), #P4.4219 This colouring induces colourings χion the copies of Eiin C2for each i. By the above Ramsey construction, there is B ∈CA2 which is monochromatic with respect to each χi. 2 In other words, we have the following possibilities: 1. The ordering ≺ on B agrees with &lt;0. 2. The ordering ≺ on agrees with &lt;0on edges and goes in the opposite direction on non-edges. 3. The ordering ≺ on B agrees with &lt;0on non-edges and goes in the opposite direction on edges. 4. The ordering ≺ on B goes in the opposite direction. Now, since A1embeds in B, the structure (A, &lt;) must embed in B with the order &lt;0 replaced by ≺ and the proof is complete. Theorem 8.7. The age of n ∗ Iω∗satisfies the expansion property with respect to the age of n ∗ Iω. Proof. Let A ∈ Age(n ∗ Iω), fix a sequence of relations PiAcorresponding to each part of A, and fix first a convex linear ordering &lt; on A that agrees with these relations. For 1 6 i 6 n, define Ei∈ Age(n ∗ Iω∗) to be the structure with universe {a, b} with no edges and such that a &lt; b and PiEi= {a, b}. Enumerate all convex orderings on A that agree with PiA’s: &lt;1, . . . , &lt;o. Find B ∈ Age(n ∗ Iω∗) so that each (A, P1A, . . . , PnA, &lt;i) embeds in B, for 1 6 i 6 o. Then find D ∈ Age(n ∗ Iω∗) so that B and all Ei’s embed in D. Since Age(n ∗ Iω∗) satisfies the Ramsey property, we can find Ci∈ Age(n ∗ Iω∗) so that C1→ (D)E21, Ci+1→ (Ci)E2i+1. Let &lt;0be the ordering on Cn, and let ≺ be any convex linear ordering on Cnthat agrees with PiCn’s. As before consider the following colourings on the copies of Eiin Cn: ( χi(E0) =0if the two orders &lt;0and ≺ agree on E0. 1otherwise By the Ramsey property we can thus find D0∈Cn which is monochromatic with respect D to χ1, . . ., χn. In other words, ≺ either agrees with &lt;0or goes in the opposite direction when restricted to any part. Furthermore, ≺ already agrees with &lt;0on edges, because we have assumed that ≺’s convexity agrees with the relations PiCn. Now, since B embeds in D0, the structure (A, P1A, . . . , PnA, &lt;) must embed in D0with the order &lt;0replaced by ≺. Let C0the reduct of Cnresulting from removing &lt;0. Given a bijection f : [n] → [n], define Cfto be C0except that PiCf= Pf (i)C0. Find a structure C00so that every Cfembeds into it. Set C0∈ Age(n∗Iω) to be the reduct of C00. For any P1C0, . . . , PnC0and any convex linear order &lt;00, we can find a convex linear order &lt;000so that (C0, P1C0, . . . , PnC0, &lt;000) the electronic journal of combinatorics 21(4) (2014), #P4.4220 embeds in (C0, P1C0, . . . , PnC0, &lt;00), by construction. Therefore, (A, P1A, . . . , PnA, &lt;) embeds in any expansion (C0, P1C0, . . . , PnC0, &lt;00), given any P1C0, . . . , PnC0, and any convex linear order &lt;00. Finally, to find the witness of the expansion property for A, take the joint embedding of all C0’s, for all sequences P1A, . . . , PnAand all convex linear orderings &lt; on A. 9P(3) Let P = (P, ≺) be the generic partial order. In this context, a subset D of P is dense if and only if for every x, z ∈ P there is y ∈ D such that x ≺ y ≺ z (see [C13]). Partition P into three dense subsets P0,P1,P2. Note that each Piis isomorphic as a partial order to P. Define P to be the directed graph with vertex set P so that (x, y) is an edge if and only if x ≺ y. Our underlying signature is L = {E} where E is the binary directed edge relation. We will temporarily consider extra binary relations TiX, for i ∈ {−1, 0, 1} and a set of pairs X. For a set of pairs X, define the relations TiXas follows: put (x, y) ∈ T−1Xif and only if (x, y) ∈ X; put (x, y) ∈ T1Xif and only if (y, x) ∈ X; finally, put (x, y) ∈ T0X, otherwise. We define P(3) as a variant of P by ``twisting'' the directed edges EP: The set of vertices of P(3) is P . Define the edges EP(3)so that (x, y) ∈ Tk+(j−i) mod 3EP(3)if and only if (x, y) ∈ TkEP, whenever x ∈ Piand y ∈ Pj. An important observation, which we will use to show the expansion property, is that a cycle of length three embeds in P(3), but not in P. Now, we define the expansion of P(3). Let L0= {E, R0, R1, R2, &lt;} be the signature, where E and &lt; are binary and Ri’s are unary. We set EP(3)∗to be EP(3). Define P(3)∗ P(3)∗ to be the expansion of P(3) where Ri= Piand &lt;P(3)∗is a linear extension of ≺ such that P(3)∗is still a Fra¨ıss´e structure. Define K to be the age of P(3)∗. Next, we define signatures L0= {≺, R0, R1, R2, &lt;}, L1= {≺, &lt;}, and L2= {R0, R1, R2, &lt;}, where Ri’s are unary, while ≺ and &lt; are binary. Define K0to be the class of finite structures (A, ≺A, RA0, RA1, RA2, &lt;A) where ≺Ais a poset on A, RAi’s partition A and &lt;Ais a linear order extending ≺A. Define Kito be the class of reducts of structures from K0with signature Li, for i ∈ {1, 2}. The class K1 already satisfies the Ramsey property, see [PTW84]. Moreover, the class K2is essentially the electronic journal of combinatorics 21(4) (2014), #P4.4221 the previously defined class OP3and its Ramsey property was demonstrated in [KPT05] (see proof of Theorem 8.4). The members of the class K0can be treated as members of the class K and vice versa. For simplicity, we suppose a given A ∈ K0is such that (A, ≺A) is a substructure of P. By the ``twisting'' procedure defined at the beginning of this section, we arrive at a member A0= (A, EA0) of the age of P(3) so that (A, EA0, R0A, RA1, RA2, &lt;A) is in the age of P(3)∗. By reversing this procedure, we may turn a given member of K into a member of K0. What follows is a short but powerful argument from [S13-2], which we include here to keep this paper as self-contained as possible, as before. The reader is invited to compare it to the proof of the result from [B12] found in [S12]. Theorem 9.1. The class K0satisfies the Ramsey property. Proof. Let A = (A, EA, RA0, RA1, RA2, &lt;A) and B = (A, EB, R0B, RB1, R2B, &lt;B) be in K. Set A1= (A, EA, &lt;A), A2= (A, RA0, RA1, R2A, &lt;A), B1= (A, EB, &lt;B), B2= (A, RB0, RB1, RB2, &lt;B). Let r be a natural number. We have C1∈ K1and C2∈ K2such that (C1, C2) → (B1, B2)(Ar1,A2) Define C ∈ K as follows: Set the universe C = C1× C2. Set (x, y) ≺C(z, w) if and only if x ≺C1z. Set (x, y) ∈ RCiif and only if y ∈ RCi2. Finally, set (x, y) &lt;C(z, w) if and only if x &lt;C1z or (x = z and y &lt;C2w). For structures D1⊆ C1, D2⊆ C2of the same size, define the diagonal substructure ∆(D1, D2) ⊆ C as follows: First define an ordering on [|D1|] × [|D2|] by setting (x, y) &lt; (z, w) if and only if x &lt; z or (x = z and y &lt; w). There is a unique order preserving map f : [|D1|] × [|D2|] → D1× D2. Set the universe of ∆(D1, D2) to be {f (1, 1), f (2, 2), . . . , f (|D1|, |D2|)}. Let C χ :→ [r]. A be a colouring. Define the induced colouring ˜χ :(C(A1,C2) → [r] by 1,A2) χ((A˜01, A02)) = χ(∆(A01, A02)). Then there is a ˜χ-monochromatic (C1, C2) (B01, B02) ∈. (B1, B2) Set B0= ∆(B01, B02). Then B0is isomorphic to B and is χ-monochromatic. the electronic journal of combinatorics 21(4) (2014), #P4.4222 Corollary 9.2. The age of P(3)∗satisfies the Ramsey property. Theorem 9.3. The age of P(3)∗satisfies the expansion property with respect to the age of P(3). Proof. We first define a list of elements of the age of P(3)∗: • If i ∈ {0, 1, 2}, set Xito be such that Xi= {x}, EXi=&lt;Xi= ∅. Moreover, set RXii= {x} and RXij= ∅ for i 6= j. • If i ∈ {0, 1, 2}, set Dito be such that Di= {x, y, z}, EDi= {(x, y), (y, z), (z, x)}, RDii= {x, y}, R(i+1) mod 3Di= {z}, &lt;Di= {(x, y), (y, z), (x, z)}. • If i, j ∈ {0, 1, 2}, i 6 j, set E+i,jto be such that Ei,j+= {x, y}, x ∈ REi+i,j, y ∈ REj+i,j. Set &lt;E+i,j= {(x, y)}. If i = j, set EE+i,j= ∅. If j = i + 1, set EE+i,j= {(y, x)}.

For i ∈ {0, 1}, define colourings χi:XC → {0, 1, 2} so that χ(X0) = i i where X0= {x} and x ∈ RCi∗.

Likewise, for 0 6 i 6 3, define χ9+i:EC− → {0, 1} g(i) by setting χ9+i(E0) = 0 whenever E0= {x, y}, x &lt;Cy and x &lt;C∗y. Furthermore, set χ9+i(E0) = 1 whenever E0= {x, y}, x &lt;Cy but x &gt;C∗y. We can find B0∈CB that is χi-monochromatic, for all i. Set kito be the colour assigned by χifor elements inBX0, i for i &lt; 3. We first show that the parts of B0determined by Ri’s remain the same in C∗(other than being perhaps reordered): more specifically, we show that ki6= kj, for i 6= j, i, j &lt; 3. Suppose otherwise, i.e., ki0= kj0, for some i06= j0, i0, j0&lt; 3. Consider a cycle D ∈DB0. i0 For all x ∈ D, we have x ∈ RDi. This means that D embeds in Piwhich is impossible 00 because (Pi0, ≺) is isomorphic to the generic partial order. We can show that for every i &gt; 3, the colouring χicannot assign the colour 1 onEB+0 g(i) orEB−0: Suppose otherwise. Let k ∈ {0, 1, 2}. Then Fkembeds in B0. If the colour of h(i) every copy of E+k,kin B0is assumed to be 1, we have that &lt;C∗restricted to Fk× Fkis a cycle. This is absurd. This means that every ``non-edge'' in B0entirely contained in a part has the same linear extension with respect to C∗and C. (*) Let k &lt; `, k, ` ∈ {0, 1, 2}. Then Gk,`embeds in B0, as well. By (*), the single non-edge of every copy of Gk,`contained entirely in a part has only one possible linear extension. If the colour of every copy of E+k,`in B0is assumed to be 1, we have that &lt;C∗restricted to Gk,`× Gk,`would again be a cycle which is again absurd. The case when k &gt; ` is similar, except we replace E+k,`with E−k,`. In other words, the extension &lt;C∗agrees with &lt;Cwhen both are restricted to B0. Thus, by construction of B and since B ∼= B0, any expansion of A∗embeds in B0and therefore in C∗. 10Semigeneric The semigeneric directed graph is the Fra¨ıss´e limit of the class S made of all those elements of Age(ω ∗ Iω) which satisfy the following parity constraint: for any two distinct parts P and P0, distinct u, v in P and distinct x, y in P0, the number of edges directed from u, v to x, y is even. We construct an expansion S∗of S by adding two binary relations symbols, R and &lt;. As usual, the symbol &lt; will be interpreted as a linear order. Let A ∈ S be k-partite. the electronic journal of combinatorics 21(4) (2014), #P4.4224 Before explaining how an expansion of A is built, let us point out a crucial fact: given two different parts P and P0of A, parity constraints imply that the following relation is well-defined, and is an equivalence relation on P : u ∼AP0viff∀x ∈ P0EA(x, u) ↔ EA(x, v). In fact there are two equivalence classes, one is {u ∈ P : EA(x, u)} and the other is {v ∈ P : EA(v, x)}, and observe these two classes do not depend on the choice of x ∈ P0. Moreover the relation ∼Adefined on A by: u ∼Aviff∃ P{u, v} ⊆ Pand∀P06= P u ∼AP0v is also an equivalence relation. Note that the number of ∼A-classes is at most k2k−1(at most 2k−1classes on each part), regardless of the actual size of A, but will eventually reach this maximum size by the joint embedding property. We now explain how an expansion A∗is constructed. We first consider a linear order T = {ti: i &lt; k}, viewed as a directed graph, where there is an edge from tito tjwhenever ti&lt; tj. This is an element of S, and thus by the joint embedding property we can take a k-partite element ¯A of S whose universe is the disjoint union of A and T and into which both A and T embed, and thus T becomes a transversal in ¯A. Next, for u and x in different parts of A, we define RA∗(x, u)iffEA¯(ti, u) where tiis the only element of T lying in the same part of ¯A as x. Finally, consider a linear order on ¯A that extends the already existing linear order on the copy of T and is A¯ convex relative to the k-partition of ¯A (but not necessarily with respect to ∼, which is finer). Then finally let &lt;A∗denote its restriction on A. Note that adding RA∗and &lt;A∗as above corresponds essentially to adding unary predicates Pi,fA∗, with i &lt; k and f ∈ [2]</text>

    <text>r{i}, that partition A into the ∼Aequivalence classes. Indeed, &lt;A∗labels the parts of A as P0&lt;A∗· · · &lt;A∗Pk−1, and RA∗gives rise to: Pi,fA∗= {u ∈ Pi: ∀j 6= i (f (j) = 0 ↔ ∀x ∈ PjRA∗(x, u))}. Note also that the edge relation of ¯A can be recovered from RA∗and &lt;A∗, and hence from (Pi,fA∗)i,fand &lt;A∗as well. To see this, let x, u ∈ ¯A be in different parts. If both of them belong to the transversal that was used to define ¯A, then the edge relation is given by the order relation &lt;A∗between any two elements of A∗from the respective parts. If exactly one of them belongs to the transversal set, say x = ti, then knowing whether there is an edge from x = tito u is directly available from the relation RA∗ evaluated at (y, u) for any y ∈ A in the same part as x = ti. On the other hand, if neither x nor u are in the transversal set, then consider the quadruple formed by x, u, and the corresponding elements txand tufrom the transversal set; in that quadruple, all edges but the one between x and u are available from RA∗and &lt;A∗as described above, and so the orientation of the edge between x and u can be deduced thanks to the parity constraint. the electronic journal of combinatorics 21(4) (2014), #P4.4225 One last comment: any element of the class of k-sequences of members of OP2k−1whose unary predicates are indexed by the set of all pairs (i, f ) with i &lt; k and f ∈ [2]</text>

    <text>r{i}with the lexicographical order, then we can induce on S[n, k] a natural lexicographical order &lt;S[n,k]∗. This is clearly convex. To define RS[n,k]∗, set: RS[n,k]∗((i0, f0, j0), (i, f, j))iffi 6= i0and f (i0) = 0. For the edge relation ES[n,k]∗, we introduce an imaginary transversal {ti: i &lt; k}, where each imaginary point ti0is attached to the part PiS[n,k]0∗. First, add an edge from ti0to tiwhenever i0&lt; i. Then for each (i, f, j) with i 6= i0, add an edge from ti0to (i, f, j) iff f (i0) = 0, i.e. whenever RS[n,k]∗((i0, f0, j0), (i, f, j)) for every point of the form (i0, f0, j0). Otherwise, add an edge in the other direction. Next, when (i, f, j) and (i0, f0, j0) are such that i 6= i0, consider the quadruple formed by (i, f, j), (i0, f0, j0), tiand ti0. There is only one way to add an oriented edge between (i, f, j) and (i0, f0, j0) in such a way that the number of edges from the pair {(i, f, j), ti} to the pair {(i0, f0, j0), ti0} is even. This is enough to ensure that the resulting directed graph structure ES[n,k]∗is in S: indeed, consider a quadruple formed by pairs {u, v}, {x, y} of elements in same parts. Add the corresponding imaginary points t and t0. For each transversal pair of {u, v, x, y}, complete it into a quadruple using {t, t0} where the parity constraint is satisfied. Identifying ES[n,k]∗ with its characteristic function, this is equivalent to saying some sum equals 0 modulo 2. For example, for {u, x}: ES[n,k]∗(u, x) + ES[n,k]∗(u, t0) + ES[n,k]∗(t, x) + ES[n,k]∗(t, t0) = 0. Adding up all these equalities for all transversal pairs of {u, v, x, y} (i.e.pairs with elements in different parts), notice that each term involving t or t0appears an even number of times, and therefore vanishes in the total sum. As a result, we obtain: ES[n,k]∗(u, x) + ES[n,k]∗(u, y) + ES[n,k]∗(v, x) + ES[n,k]∗(v, y) = 0. This shows that the parity constraint is satisfied on {u, v, x, y}, and shows that S[n, k]∗∈ S∗. We call S[n, k] the corresponding reduct in S. Let us emphasize the following property of S[n, k]: the electronic journal of combinatorics 21(4) (2014), #P4.4226 Lemma 10.1. Every part of S[n, k] is partitioned into 2k−1many ∼S[n,k]-classes, each of size n. Proof. Fix i &lt; k. By construction, the ∼S[n,k]-classes inside the i-th part of S[n, k] are the sets Pi,fS[n,k]∗= {(i, f, j) : j &lt; n}, where f runs over [2]</text>

    <text>r{i}. Clearly, each has size n. We define AS to consist of the elements of S∗with the ordering removed. Remembering how an expansion in S∗is intuitively built (by adding a transversal), a direct consequence of the previous lemma is the following corollary: Corollary 10.2. All expansions of S[n, k] in AS are isomorphic. We will use this result later on to prove the expansion property of S∗relative to S. Before that, here is another direct consequence of the various facts we stated above, together with the Ramsey property for k-sequences of members OP2k−1(see Lemma 3.3): Corollary 10.3. Suppose A∗, B∗∈ S∗are k-partite. Then for any r there exists a kpartite C∗∈ S∗such that, C∗→ (B∗)Ar∗. With this fact in mind, we now prove that S∗has the Ramsey property. Corollary 10.4. Suppose A∗, B∗∈ S∗are k-partite and `-partite respectively. Then for any r there exists an `-partite C∗∈ S∗such that any r-colouring χ of the copies of A∗ with a fixed trace τ , there exists a χ-monochromatic ˜B ∈CB∗∗. We symbolize this by C∗→ (B∗)Ar∗,τ. Proof. Let D∗be the graph induced by the the elements of B∗with trace τ . Use Corollary 10.3, to get a k-partite E∗such that E∗→ (D∗)Ar∗. Now extend each copy of D∗in E∗to a copy of B∗with trace [`], via amalgamation. Finally, add edges outside of these copies, as necessary. Corollary 10.5. Suppose A∗, B∗∈ S∗are k-partite and `-partite respectively. Then for any r there exists an `-partite C∗∈ S∗such that for any r-colouring χ of the copies of A∗, there exists ˜B ∈CB∗∗ such that the colouring χ restricted toAB˜∗ depends only on the trace. We symbolize this as C∗→ (B∗)Ar∗,tr. Proof. Enumerate subsets of [`] of size k: τ1, . . ., τn. Set C∗1→ (B∗)Ar∗,τ1. Set C∗i→ (C∗i−1)A∗,τifor i &gt; 1. Finally, set C∗= C∗n. We are now ready for the full Ramsey result for S∗. the electronic journal of combinatorics 21(4) (2014), #P4.4227 Theorem 10.6. The age of S∗is Ramsey. Proof. Suppose A∗, B∗∈ S∗, and r are given. We show that there exists an ˜C∗∈ S∗such that C∗→ (B∗)Ar∗. First we apply Ramsey’s theorem to the traces and use Corollary 10.5. Let k 6 ` ∈ N such that B∗is `-partite and A∗is a k-partite substructure of B∗. Using Ramsey’s theorem, we can find m such that m → (`)kr. Enumerate the `-subsets of [m] as τ1, . . . , τ`. For each i 6 ` consider a copy B∗iof B with trace τiin the Fra¨ıss´e limit S∗of S∗so that the B∗i’s are pairwise disjoint. Set ¯B∗to be the m-partite substructure of S∗supported by the union of these B∗i’s. Using corollary 10.5, we can find an m-partite C∗in S∗such that every r-colouring χ ofCA∗∗, there exists a copy ¯B0∈B¯C∗ such that χ restricted toAB¯∗0 depends only on the trace. Define ¯χ :mk → [r] by setting ¯χ(σ) to be the colour of any copy of A∗in ¯B0with trace σ. This is well defined by construction. By choice of m, there is a ¯χ-homogeneous τi0of size `. By construction, there is B0∈B¯0 with trace τ B∗i0, which completes the proof. It remains to show that S∗has the expansion property relative to S. In order to do this, fix A ∈ S as well as an expansion A∗of A in S∗. We will be done once the following two lemmas are proved: Lemma 10.7. There exists ¯B ∈ AS for which any expansion of ¯B in S∗contains A∗. Proof. Consider all the expansions A∗0, . . . , A∗sof A obtained from A∗by reversing &lt;A∗ on some parts. Let ˆAbe k-partite and containing them all. Then A∗embeds in ˆA∗, Aˆ∗ even when &lt;is reversed in any of its parts. Next, use the Ramsey property in S∗with colourings of edges and non-edges as in Theorem 8.6 to create ¯B∗so that any convex linear ordering ≺ on ¯Bis so that ( ¯B, EB¯∗, RB¯∗, ≺) contains a copy of ˆA∗up to a reversing of ≺ in some of the parts. Then, the reduct ¯B of ¯B∗in AS is as required. Lemma 10.8. There exists B ∈ S for which any expansion in AS contains ¯B. Proof. Observe that for k and n large enough, we can embed the reduct of ¯B in S[n, k]. Then S[n, k] has the required property thanks to Corollary 10.2. 11Conclusion Having constructed Ramsey precompact expansions of all homogeneous directed graphs and having verified the expansion property in each case, we are automatically given a list of the respective universal minimal flows. Suppose F is one of the homogeneous directed graphs and F∗= (F,−R→∗) is its precompact expansion which we have constructed. The age of F∗satisfies the Ramsey property as well as the respective expansion property and the electronic journal of combinatorics 21(4) (2014), #P4.4228 consists of rigid elements. Consequently, its automorphism group is extremely amenable. Let G be the automorphism group of F. Moreover, recall that the logic action of G on −→ G ·R∗is the universal minimal flow (see Theorem 1.2). In particular, we arrive at the following table, summarizing the results of this paper, where we omit the cases when T is finite (in these cases refer to the the definitions preceding Theorem 5.7 and Theorem 7.8). −→ Homogeneous directed graph(s) FExpanded languageR∗ T[In], In</text>

Completing the list of Ramsey precompact expansions of homogeneous structures and subsequently computing their universal minimal flows is an ever continuing undertaking. For example, we have examples of homogeneous metric spaces whose Ramsey precompact expansions are still unknown. In particular from the work of Cherlin in [C13], and related more closely to the subject of this paper, are classes of metrically homogeneous graphs, i.e., ones that are homogeneous with respect to the graph metric. the electronic journal of combinatorics 21(4) (2014), #P4.4229 Acknowledgements This project was finished while both of us, Claude Laflamme and Lionel Nguyen Van Th´e, were attending the thematic program Universality and Homogeneity at the Hausdorff Research Institute for Mathematics in Bonn.
